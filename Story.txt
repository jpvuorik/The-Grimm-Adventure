Your name is Klaus Heinrich and you are 11 years old. You've lived your entire life in a small village near Strassburg.
Orphaned at a young age, you were raised by your grandmother. She has always been nice to you, but losing your parents
has made you jaded for your age. Because you're big for your age, this has led to you becoming something of a school
bully. You're big, good in a fight and you've always loved the stories grandma tells you at night. You're also not
very good aat studying and you're childhood traumas have left you easily scared at times. You always carry with you
your cigarette lighter, a pack of cigarettes and a baseball bat.

You've been left in detention once again.
